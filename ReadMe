This Document gives a step by step procedure of running the Sift_Bow.py file.

1. Unzip the Python_Code.zip. It contains the following:
	--> training: This folder has images for the Sift_Bow.py to train.
        --> testing: This foldr has the images on which the Sift_Bow.py performs testing.
        --> Sift_Bow.py: This is the code for performing Object Recognition using the classical SIFT Bag of Words approach. 

2. Open the Sift_Bow.py file.

3. On the Line 14 of the code, update the path to training images

4. On the line 17 of the code, update the path to testing images.

5. That is all you need to do for the code to run succesfully.

Results: 

--> Predicted Labels: It gives the predicted labels by the Sift_Bow model.
--> Ground Truth: It is the actual labels of the testing images. 
--> Accuracy: It gives the percentage of correct estimation.
